# Hunt Showdown: Match Tracker

Hunt Showdown: Match Tracker (HSMT) is a tool to keep a record of your match history. It will show you whoever was in your match and ways for you to see information about people you have played against. The software is still in pre-release so do expect bugs and weird behaviour every now and then. Please be sure to leave issues here on github if you experience any.

## How to Install/Update
- Go to https://github.com/deffy92/HuntShowdownMatchTracker/releases
- Download the .exe file that is flagged with "latest".
- Run Exe and it will install the latest update.

## Why doesnt the software autoupdate?
I have yet to decide on how I want to go forward with implementing an auto updater. So for now I will notify everyone in our Discord to update to the latest version.
